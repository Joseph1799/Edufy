## Development Workflow

Edufy follows an agile development process using Scrum, with sprints focusing on delivering incremental improvements. We use **DevOps** practices for continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD), ensuring a smooth development pipeline. The project team collaborates closely through daily stand-ups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives to continually refine and improve the product.

## System Architecture

The project utilizes **C# ASP .NET** for backend development, ensuring robust, scalable, and maintainable server-side operations. The **Microsoft SQL Server** database is used to handle all data management needs, storing user data, course details, assignments, and more.

### Class Diagram

The system's class diagram illustrates the relationships between various entities in the platform, such as users (students and professors), courses, assignments, and grades.

### Database Schema

The database is designed to support all essential operations for the platform, such as user management, course management, and assignment tracking. It utilizes normalized tables for efficient data storage and retrieval.
